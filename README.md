# Izibalo for Android

For 2nd-year coursework for my degree (2016) I was tasked to create a system which integrates an aspect of geocaching into it, however, this only required prototypes to only be built.

This task was split into 2 separate projects a desktop app & a mobile app. This particular part of the project was to build a high fidelity prototype for the Android app.

Being a fan of football, I decided that my idea would be based on football. It was to store all cities and towns along with all the players born there, and set users the task to then go to each place and then mark on the mobile app as 'visited' by providing proof via an image of landmark of the city along with a fact of the player and using GPS to check they are at the location.

As I love football I thought it will be interesting to test football fans knowledge of the facts of the players. Also as a prize to adding a cache, users will be able to view previous caches, this is where users will be able to view their fact/s they entered as well as what other users entered. This will hopefully then be used to expand their knowledge of players.

We were given the ability to use any tool to create this prototype, and I had chosen Proto.io to build it with.
